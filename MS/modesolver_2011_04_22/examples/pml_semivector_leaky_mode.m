% This example illustrates how to use perfectly matched layers
% at the edges of the computation window. The waveguide
% considered here is the same as in 'basic_semivector.m', with
% the exception that we have added a substrate layer that has
% the same refractive index of the core.  The modesolver
% computes a complex propagation constant that includes the
% propagation loss associated with radiation into the
% substrate.  
%
% Note that the perfectly-matched layer is constructed using
% the stretchmesh routine, with a complex stretching factor
% (i.e., complex coordinate stretching.)

% Refractive indices:
ns = 3.44;          % Substrate
n1 = 3.34;          % Lower cladding
n2 = 3.44;          % Core
n3 = 1.00;          % Upper cladding (air)

% Vertical dimensions:
hs = 4.0;           % Substrate
h1 = 1.1;           % Lower cladding
h2 = 1.3;           % Core thickness
h3 = 0.5;           % Upper cladding
rh = 1.1;           % Ridge height

% Horizontal dimensions:
rw = 1.0;           % Ridge half-width
side = 1.5;         % Space on side

% Grid size:
dx = 0.0125;        % grid size (horizontal)
dy = 0.0125;        % grid size (vertical)

lambda = 1.55;      % vacuum wavelength
nmodes = 1;         % number of modes to compute
