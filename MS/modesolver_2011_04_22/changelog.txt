Corrected bug in stretchmesh routine, which caused the complex
coordinate stretching to be negative in the south and west boundaries, but
positive in the north and east boundaries.  Also corrected a bug in
wgmodes and svmodes in which dy was incorrected conjugated.

(Thanks to Jiri Petracek for discovering this bug.)

Modified the contourmode and imagemode plotting routines to make them more
user-friendly.

Corrected algebraic error in the expressions for Axy(E),
Axy(W), Ayx(N) and Ayx(S). The earlier version was only correct
in the special case when e=w and n=s. (I.e., when the mesh is
uniform in the vicinity of the dielectric edges.) Many thanks
to yuchunlu_china@hotmail.com, who pointed out this bug. The
corrected expressions now agree with the isotropic equations of
Lusse et al, in limit that the materials are isotropic.

Corrected small error in external plotting functions:  replaced
"transp" with "transpose", which works for all versions of
MATLAB.
